# WD-VirtualAssistant
 
 Hello , and welcome to another of my projects! 
 This project is a program that will work with Warp-Drive's Virtual Assistant block.
 With this program , you will be able to set custom chat commands , by simply putting your own lua script to execute in /home/AIScript/
 
# How to add a script
 - First, of course, you need to create your own script.
 - Once you're done, you need to rename your script into the command
 For example: say we have the prefix `JJS` and the script named `test.lua`, saying `JJS test` in the chat will execute this script.
 - Then , you need to move your .lua script into `/home/AIScript/`
 - And woah! you now have a script that you can launch from the chat!!
 
# Disclaimer
 i'm **really** not a pro or a very high-level Lua user, my code is probably laggy and not very optimized, but it works!
